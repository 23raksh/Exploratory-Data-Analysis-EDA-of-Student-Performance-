## Objective:
In this EDA project, we delve into a comprehensive dataset capturing various aspects of student performance in academic assessments. The dataset encompasses crucial features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course completion status, as well as scores in math, reading, and writing.

The dataset provides a rich source of information that allows us to explore questions such as:

Is there a correlation between parental level of education and student performance?
Does completing a test preparation course lead to higher exam scores?
Are there differences in performance based on gender, race/ethnicity, or lunch type?
How do scores in math, reading, and writing correlate with each other?


## Conclusion:
By understanding the dynamics of student performance and the factors that contribute to academic success, this analysis aims to contribute to evidence-based decision-making in education and foster a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between student characteristics and educational outcomes.
